# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue stems from improper handling of asynchronous operations and data updates.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches user data from a public API.  While the API call is successful, the FlatList remains empty.  The console shows no errors.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly handling the asynchronous nature of the API call and ensuring the `data` state is updated properly before rendering the FlatList.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device.
4. Observe that the FlatList is empty despite the successful API call.

## How to Fix

The solution is provided in the `DataFetchSolution.js` file.
